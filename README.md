## Project Overview

In preparation for an upcoming union election, a survey was conducted to gather workers' perspectives on topics including trust in the voting process, barriers to voting, perceptions of leadership, workplace satisfaction, and preferred voting methods. This analysis is part of a broader effort to ensure union elections are representative of the entire worker community.

### Goals

- Identify demographic patterns related to voter turnout.
- Analyze reasons for non-participation and how these vary across demographics.
- Explore the influence of perceptions of union and company leadership on voting behavior.
- Assess the impact of workplace satisfaction factors on voter turnout.
- Evaluate preferred voting methods and their perceived security and accessibility.
